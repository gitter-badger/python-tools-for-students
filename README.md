## What do you need?
* A base knowlage in Python

We won't teach you python from from the ground up so you already have some basic knowlage about python.
For this porpouse we recomment that you compleate i.e. the
[SoloLearn Python 3 Tutorial](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/)
, which is also available as a free mobile app and/or 
watch the tutorial made by 
[sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXBD2bB9-RA&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln)

## Who are we?
We are a group of master students from TU-Berlin (Germany), 
who want to share their experience with python tools, 
which make the day to day life at univerity 
(homework, writing reports and evaluating data) easyer.

## Why in english?
Even so we are a group of german students, the community of english speaking Programmers 
is much bigger than the one of Programmers which only speak german. 
And since most problems you might have, other people already had and solved it it of benefit 
to know the terms we introduce in english to since this gives you access to a bigger knowlage base 
(google/duckduckgo and stackoverflow are your friends).
