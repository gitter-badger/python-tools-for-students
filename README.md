# python-tools-for-students

This projects aims to teach students the basics of how to use 
**powerful Python Tools** for the day to day life at university:
* Solving equations
    * Analytically
    * Nummerically
* Handeling data
     * Reading differently structured plaintext files
     * Doing calculations on data
     * Fitting of data
     * Visualisation (plotting)
     
### Where are we with this project right now?
At the moment we are gathering ideas what to teach and build a usefull 
structure to teach the materials. Which is why **this is your chance** 
to tell us what you want to learn. Just open an issue, write about what you want to learn
(examples help with explanations) and we can discuss
if this should be part of this course or is too much of an edge case.
And of course we are also always happy if you want to contribute and teach others the skills
you acquired.


### What do you need?
* **A base knowledge in Python**

    We won't teach you python from the ground up so you already have some basic knowledge about python.
    For this purpose we recommend that you complete i.e. the
    [SoloLearn Python 3 Tutorial](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/), 
    which is also available as a free mobile app and/or watch the tutorials made by 
    [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXBD2bB9-RA&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeAams7fkdcwOGBpGdHpXln)
    
* **A working python installation**

    The best way to get Python up and running for your OS is to download 
    [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), which is crossplatform and
    comes with most tools needed prebundled (batteries included).
    
* **A github account**

    The github account is needed so you can write issues and tell us what **YOU** want to learn, 
    what we should improve or if we did something wrong.
    

## Who are we?
We are a group of master students from TU-Berlin (Germany), 
who want to share their experience with python tools, 
which make the day to day life at university 
(homework, writing reports and evaluating data) easier.

## Why in english?
Even so we are a group of german students, the community of english speaking programmers 
is much bigger than the one of programmers which only speak german. 
And since most problems you might have, other people already had and solved it of benefit 
to know the terms we introduce in english to since this gives you access to a bigger knowledge base 
(google/duckduckgo and stackoverflow are your friends).
